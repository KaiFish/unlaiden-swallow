			<div id="header"><a href="/cs320-spring2021/">CS 320</a>: Lab 3: Using Git Part 1</div>
			<p>In this lab, you will practice using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, which is currently the most widely used and arguably the best version control system.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h2>

<p>Be aware of the following fact:</p>

<div class="callout">
Git has a bit of a learning curve.
</div>

<p>It may be more than a bit of a learning curve.  You will probably find Git to be fairly confusing for a while.  Eventually, it will make sense.  I promise.</p>

<p>As with most worthwhile skills, becoming proficient with Git takes some work.  The best advice is to <em>think carefully</em> about what you’re doing.</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind:</p>

<div class="callout">
Git is one of the most awesome and powerful software development tools ever created.
</div>

<p>Like <a href="../lectures/lecture10.html">OO Analysis</a>, Git proficiency is a software development super power.</p>

<h2>Step 0: Become a Collaborator </h2>
<p> Fill out the form <a href="https://forms.gle/sEfwxLQhwJHbEZWo6">here</a> so that the tutors can add you as contributors to the repository. If you have not been added as a contributor, let your tutor know. </p>


<h2 id="step-1-Clone">Step 1: Clone</h2>

<p>Go to the following GitHub repository page:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/KaiFish/MoveTheSquare.git">https://github.com/KaiFish/MoveTheSquare.git</a></p>

<p>Using the git client of your choice (and the instructions from the lecture), clone the repository and extract the Eclipse Project into your workspace.

<h2 id="step-2-branch">Step 2: Branch </h2>
	<p> Following the instructions from the lecture, make a branch on the repository. Name it your ycp username. </p>

<h2 id="step-3-make-changes">Step 3: Make changes</h2>

<p>You can run the program from <strong>src → edu.ycp.cs320.movethesquare.ui</strong>, right clicking on <strong>GameView</strong> and choosing <strong>Run As → Java Application</strong>.</p>

<p>Make some changes to the code. Suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change the colors</li>
  <li>make the square bigger or smaller</li>
  <li>use a circle instead of a square</li>
  <li>make the square move faster</li>
  <li>prevent the square from moving outside the boundaries of the window</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-4-commit-and-push-your-changes">Step 8: Commit and push your changes</h2>

<p>Once you have made a change, commit your changes and push your branch to the remote repository. </p>

<h2 id="step-5-pull-request">Step 5: Pull Request</h2>
<p>Once you have pushed your branch, open a pull request. Consult the lecture if you need instructions. <b> DO NOT MERGE YOUR PULL REQUEST </b>
	We will look at these pull requests in the next git lecture. </p>
