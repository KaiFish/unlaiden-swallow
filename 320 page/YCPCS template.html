      <ul>

      </ul>
      <h2 id="version-control">A Brief History of git</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          To talk about the history of git you must first talk about the history
          of Linux. The Linux kernel is a very large and very old open source
          project. Open Source means that is has many people working on it, not
          connected to any organization or business. This creates a problem,
          however; how do contributors share and combine their work, with
          everyone working at the same time? The answer is version control. In
          the beginning, also known as the 90s, changes were passed around as
          patches and archived files. This was not much better than emailing
          files back and forth. In 2002, the Linux Community moved to BitKeeper,
          a propietary, but at the time free, version control software. Then in
          2005, it became not free. This made a lot of people unhappy and was
          widely considered a bad move. Linux people did not want to go back to
          emailing files back and forth, so Linus Torvalds did what Linus
          Torvalds does, and made his own version control system. Thus, git was
          born. It had a lot of improvements over other version control systems,
          like branching, and quickly became the most widely used version
          control system, much to the dismay of everyone trying to make money
          off of version control. It remains free and open source, managed by a
          non-profit. If you want to know anything (or everything) there is to
          know about git, you can go to
          <a href="https://git-scm.com">https://git-scm.com</a> where there are
          comprehensive reference manuals and guides, all for free.
        </p>
      </ul>

        />
      </ul>

      <h1 id="version-control">git set up</h1>

      <h2 id="version-control">Part 1: Create a GitHub account</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Go to <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and sign up
        </li>
        <li>Verify your e-mail</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you did not use a .edu email, go to your account settings and add
            your .edu email as an alternate email: Profile (top right corner) >
            Settings > Email
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          You can then go to https://education.github.com/pack and get the
          Student Developer pack. This will give you access to thousands of
          dollars of free credits and materials on tons of platforms
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="version-control">Part 2: Pick a Git Client</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Git Clients are a visual alternative to doing git through command
          line. There are many different options for Git Clients. This page
          walks you through using two free choices: GitHub Desktop and
          GitKraken. GitHub Desktop is bare bones and very easy to use, but
          doesn't have many extra features. GitKraken has more features (and a
          pro version), and also has a visual display of your repository's
          branches. (more on branches later)
        </p>

        <h3 id="version-control">Downloading GitHub Desktop</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Go to
            <a href="https://desktop.github.com">https://desktop.github.com</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you move it from downloads, as it will run in your
            downloads folder if you let it.
          </li>
          <li>Sign in to GitHub.com</li>
          <li>You will then be directed to "Configure Git"</li>
          <li>
            Enter the Name/Email you want to be associated with your commits
          </li>
          <li>Click continue</li>
          <li>It will ask for usage stats.</li>
          <li>Click Finish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="version-control">Downloading GitKraken</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Go to
            <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com">https://www.gitkraken.com</a>
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy the adorable loading animation</li>
          <li>Sign in with GitHub</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you are already logged in to GitHub this is as easy as clicking
              authorize App
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Fill out your profile name, and then your name and email that will
            be associated with your commits
          </li>
          <li>Click okay</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="version-control">Part 3: Create a Repository</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          A repository (or repo) is where your code is stored. You have a remote
          repository, that is located on a service like GitHub, and a local
          repository, on your machine. You work on the code on your local
          repository, and then commit your changes and push them to your remote
          repository. When you are starting a new repository it is always easier
          to create your remote repository first, and then bring it to your
          machine.
        </p>
        <h3>On GitHub</h3>

          <p>
            To create a new repository on GitHub, you can either hit the green
            "New" button next to "Repositories" on the left of the home page, or
            click the "+" menu by your profile in the upper right and select
            "New Repository." This will take you to a new page:

            alt="image"
          />
          <p><b>In this form:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enter a repository name</li>
            <li>Select public or private.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Public repositories can be seen by everyone, private
                repositories can only be seen by added collaborators
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Optional:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add a README - This is a long description of your repository and
              what it's about (this is highly recommended)
            </li>
            <li>
              Add .gitignore - This file tells git which files in your repo not
              to track. It is very useful for Java because you do not want to
              commit .class files (a repository is only for source code)
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                GitHub is nice and has template .gitignore files based on the
                language you are using.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Add a License - GitHub is dedicated to supporting open source, but
              an important part of open source is letting people know what can
              and cannot be done with your code. A license is a document that
              states those rules. GitHub has
              <a href="https://choosealicense.com"
                >https://choosealicense.com</a
              >
              to help you pick one.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <b>Click the green "Create Repository" Button when you are done.</b>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="version-control">Part 4: Clone the Repository</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          The process of bringing a remote (online) repository to your computer
          is called cloning. On your preferred git client select the option for
          cloning your repository
        </p>

          <li>Click "Clone a Repository from the Internet..."</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You will be able to search the repositories connected to your
              GitHub account and select the one you want to clone. It will show
              you the "Local Path" where it will put the repository. Select
              "Choose" to change this.

        <p>
          Eclipse is fussy when it comes to repositories. Below are the
          instructions for using a repository with no existing Eclipse Project,
          and for getting an Eclipse Project from a repository you have cloned
          to your machine.

      <h1 id="version-control">git mechanics</h1>
      <h2 id="version-control">How to git it</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Git saves your work, but only when you tell it to. The process for
          telling it what to save to your repository is called committing. The
          repository on your machine is called your local repository. The
          repository on GitHub is called your remote or upstream repository. To
          save changes to your local repository you do "git add" and then "git
          commit". To move changes from your local repository to your remote
          repository you must do a "git push" git tracks any and all changes
          made to the repository. These changes, until you tell git otherwise,
          are "unstaged," which means that git will not record them. To stage
          these changes you must do a "git add". To add these to your local
          repository you must do a "git commit" The direction below explain how
          to do this process on GitHub Desktop and GitKraken.
        </p>

        <h3>GitHub Desktop</h3>
        <img
          src="./YCPCS template_files/GitHubGitAdd.png"
          width="50%"
          height="50%"
          alt="image"
        />
        <p>
          The Panel on the left shows you all the files that have been changed.
          GitHub Desktop automatically stages (adds) these for you, which is
          indicated by a check mark. If you DO NOT want to add a file, you can
          uncheck it to unstage it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can click on any of the file names and GitHub Desktop will show
          you the changes made in the file between versions (This is called a
          "git diff")
        </p>
        <img
          src="./YCPCS template_files/GitHubCommit.png"
          width="50%"
          height="50%"
          alt="image"
        />
        <p>
          To commit these files to your repository you MUST add a commit message
          in the "Summary" field. The message should explain what you did in
          this commit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to be more detailed you can add more information in the
          "Description" field.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are ready to commit, click the blue "Commit" button at the
          bottom of the right panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have committed your changes, the main section will offer
          "some friendly suggestions on what to do next" (If it doesn't, select
          the "changes" tab on the left panel)
        </p>
        <img
          src="./YCPCS template_files/GitHubpushh.png"
          width="70%"
          height="70%"
          alt="image"
        />
        <p>
          Here, you can click "Push origin" and push your changes to GitHub.
          (Origin is another name for remote)
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a "Push origin" button on the top bar of the window,
          with a number indicating how many commits you are pushing.
        </p>

        <h3>GitKraken</h3>
        <p>
          The panel on the right shows you all the files that have been changed
          under "Unstaged Files".
        </p>
        <p>
          You can click on any of the file names and GitKraken will show you any
          changes made between versions. (This is called a "git diff")
        </p>

      <h1>git collaboration</h1>
      <ul>
        <p>
          The process of add, commit, push is all good and fine when you are
          working by yourself. <b> IT DOES NOT WORK </b>when you are working in
          a team. To effectively work in a team you must use branches. Before
          you branch, you must pull. Before you do any of that, you must add
          collaborators to your repository.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h2>Step 0: Add Collaborators</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Collaborators are people who are authorized to work on your
          repository. To add them go to the settings tab and click "Manage
          access" and then "Invite a collaborator"
        </p>
        <img
          src="./YCPCS template_files/invite.png"
          width="50%"
          height="50%"
          alt="image"
        />
        <p>
          A window will come up where you can look up GitHub users by username
          or email. Select who you want to invite, and GitHub will send an
          invite to their email. They must accept this email before they can do
          anything with the repo.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./YCPCS template_files/lookup.png"
          width="50%"
          height="50%"
          alt="image"
        />
        <h3>A Word of Advice</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>
            Collaborators can do anything to your repository that you can do,
            with few limitations. When people do not know what they are doing,
            or abuse their privleges, things can get very messy very quickly.
            While you are in the Settings menu, it is highly reccomended that
            you click on "Branches" and then "Add rule"
          </p>
          <img
            src="./YCPCS template_files/addRule.png"
            width="50%"
            height="50%"
            alt="image"
          />
          <p>
            After that apply the following settings and click the green "Create"
            button:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./YCPCS template_files/branchRule.png"
            width="70%"
            height="70%"
            alt="image"
          />
          <p>
            These settings means no one can make and apply changes without
            someone else reviewing and approving them. This will make your life
            easier.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 1: pull</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            Before you make a branch you must check to make sure there are no
            new changes on the remote. To get these changes you must "fetch" the
            remote and "pull" the changes into your local repository
          </p>
          <h3>GitHub Desktop</h3>
          <ul>
            <p>
              GitHub Desktop will usually regularly fetch for you, but it is
              good practice to click the "Fetch" button in the top bar to make
              sure it is up to date. If there are changes, the "Fetch" button
              will change to a "Pull" button. Clicking "Pull" will merge these
              changes into your local repository. If this does not work, go to
              the section labeled "git conflicts"
            </p>
            <img
              src="./YCPCS template_files/GitHubPull.png"
              width="50%"
              height="50%"
              alt="image"
            />
          </ul>
          <h3>GitKraken</h3>
          <ul>
            <p>
              GitKraken will fetch and pull in one click. All you need to do is
              click the "Pull" button at the top of the window. If this does not
              work, go to the section labeled "git conflicts"
            </p>
            <img
              src="./YCPCS template_files/GitKrakenPull.png"
              width="50%"
              height="50%"
              alt="image"
            />
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 2: branch</h2>

        <p>
          Your main branch should always contain working code. You should
          <b>never</b> program on your main branch.
        </p>
